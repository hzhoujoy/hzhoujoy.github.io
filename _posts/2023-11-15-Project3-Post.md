## GitHub Strategies and Diabetes Modeling: A Project 3 Reflection

### Project Overview
Project 3 is a partner project with all project-related activities consolidated within a GitHub repository. We used a diabetes data set from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexteboul/diabetes-health-indicators-dataset/) for conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA), creating predictive models for diabetes outcomes, and automating R Markdown reports. The primary target variable, Diabetes_binary, distinguishes 0 for no diabetes and 1 for prediabetes or diabetes. High blood pressure, High cholesterol, BMI, Smoker, Fruits, Veggies, and Age were used as key predictors. 

The EDA phase encompassed basic statistics and visualizations. Given the dataset's size, we sub-divided it into five datasets corresponding to different education levels (Some Elementary, Some High School, High School, Some College, and College). Post EDA, the dataset underwent a split into 70% training and 30% test subsets for each educational level. Subsequently, six models were trained and evaluated to discern the most effective model for predicting diabetes outcomes.

### Reflections on the Project
#### What would you do differently?
This project marked my initial experience using GitHub for collaborative work with a partner. In future endeavors, I intend to establish a more detailed plan before project initiation to avoid conflicts. Additionally, I plan to develop proficiency in working with smaller datasets and practice the processes of pushing and pulling data to and from GitHub before the project started. Consulting other published works for insights is also something I would prioritize.

#### What was the most difficult part for you?
The most challenging aspect for me revolved around managing updates on GitHub. I encountered numerous instances of warnings while attempting to push or pull the project to/from GitHub. Moreover, a significant amount of time was spent to write code and practice for automating R Markdown.

#### What are your big takeaways from this project?
The project provided valuable insights into problem-solving strategies. Utilizing Google for searching and finding appropriate solutions proved instrumental in overcoming challenges. Effective communication with my partner was pivotal; frequent discussions and alignment of efforts were key to successfully completing the project.
