*What do you think being a data scientist is about?*  

As a data scientist, I can analyze diverse sets of data to draw conclusions, predict trends, and refine future experimental plans.

*What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas? * 
The primary responsibilities of data scientists encompass data collection, preparation, analysis, and effective communication of findings with others. 
This multifaceted role draws from a wide array of knowledge domain including mathematics, statistics, computer science, engineering, business and economics, as well as natural sciences. 
 
*What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?*  
A statistician is proficient in conducting essential statistical analysis, visualizing data, and effectively communicating their findings.  
Both data scientists and statistician share many commonalities; however, data scientists typically engage with more intricate datasets, 
frequently integrated within production systems, and employ advanced modeling to data.  
So statistician can be considered as occupying a fundamental role within the field of data science.

*How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?*  
I have begun my journey into data science, having completed one course titled ‘Statistics for Management and Social Sciences I’ and a foundational SAS class. 
Currently I consider myself at an entry-level point in the field of statistics, and I am dedicated to enhancing my skill set with the aim of becoming a proficient data scientist in the future.
