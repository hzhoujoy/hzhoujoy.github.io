## `disease.sh - Open Disease Data API` Vignette
### **Introduction**
In this vignette, I will provide instructions on how to access and analyze data from the disease.sh - Open Disease Data API. The API provides valuable information about diseases, including Covid-19, and offers a wide range of endpoints for data retrieval.
### **Data Retrieval and Analysis**
To summarize the work accomplished in this vignette, I developed functions to interact with various endpoints of the disease.sh - Open Disease Data API. I retrieved data from these endpoints and conducted exploratory data analysis using various techniques, including numerical summaries, contingency tables, and data visualization with plots.
### **Key Findings**
During the analysis, I made several interesting observations:
- Fluctuations in reported variants over the years, which correlated with emergency Covid-19 cases.
- A significant association between higher distributed vaccination doses and lower mortality rates from Covid-19.
- A surprising positive correlation between reported Covid-19 cases and distributed vaccination doses, which was unexpected.
### **Learning Experience**
Throughout this project, I applied the knowledge I have gained in my data analysis journey. Asking precise questions on search engines helped me find relevant examples to solve problems I encountered. Additionally, reading public materials on R programming and APIs enhanced my understanding of writing effective code.
### **Challenges Faced**
I encountered some challenges during the process:
- The volatility of data obtained from the API made it challenging to maintain a stable data structure.
- Limited information in the retrieved data sets posed limitations on the depth of analysis that could be conducted.
### **Future Directions**
In future projects, I plan to explore APIs more extensively and consider using APIs that require an API key. This will enable me to access richer and more comprehensive datasets for analysis.
