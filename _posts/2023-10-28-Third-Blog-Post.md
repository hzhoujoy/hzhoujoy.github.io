## **Variable Selection in Regression Models**

When constructing regression models, determining the variables and their transformations for inclusion in the modeling process can be a challenging task. This process requires both experience and a deep understanding of the data. Various variable selection techniques are available, and choosing the appropriate one can be complex, particularly for those new to the field.   

### Background Knowledge and Data Exploration
Before embarking on variable selection, it is essential to gather background knowledge about the data. This may include consulting with the principal scientist or referring to previous studies in the same research domain to establish a comprehensive grasp of the dataset. This acquired knowledge serves as a foundational starting point for variable selection. Additionally, conducting basic Data Exploratory Analysis can aid in identifying outliers and influential data points, allowing for their exclusion when necessary. If applicable, variable transformations should also be considered.

### Events-per-Variable (EPV) Ratio
The ratio between the sample size and the number of variables, often referred to as "events-per-variable" (EPV), plays a crucial role in variable selection. Typically, EPV should be greater than 10, and sometimes as high as 1:15, to warrant variable selection. When candidate selected variables exhibit strong correlations, increasing the EPV is advisable.

### Popular Variable Selection Methods
There are several widely used variable selection algorithms, each with its unique approach:

- __`Backward Elimination (BE)`__: Initiate with all predictors in the global model and iteratively remove the predictor with the highest p-value exceeding a specified threshold ($α_{B}$). Continue this process until all p-values in the multivariable model are below a predetermined significance level ($α_{B}$).   
- __`Forward Selection (FS)`__: Begin with an empty model and introduce predictors with p-values below the predefined significance level $α_{F}$, provided they are not currently in the model. Continue this process until no new predictors meet the criteria.  
- __`Stepwise`__: This approach combines backward elimination and forward selection, addressing situations where variables are introduced or removed early in the process and allowing for reconsideration. Variables may be added or removed at each stage, with various variations of this procedure.  
- __`Best Subset Selection`__: This method estimates all $2^{k}$ possible models for k variables to identify the best subset of variables for inclusion in a regression model. The selection of the best model is based on an information criterion, such as the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) or Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC).  
- __`Univariable Selection`__: Univariable selection estimates all univariable models. In this process, independent variables (IVs) are included in a multivariable model if they exhibit a significant association with the outcome in univariable models.    
- __`LASSO (Least Angle Selection and Shrinkage Operator)`__: LASSO applies a penalty equal to the absolute sum of regression coefficients on the sum of squares or log likelihood. It is often used in high-dimensional model selection problems. While LASSO introduces intentional bias, it can result in smaller mean squared error (MSE) compared to conventional estimates. Nevertheless, interpreting LASSO-estimated coefficients in explanatory or descriptive models can be challenging. Confidence intervals based on resampling procedures may not achieve their nominal level. Another consideration is the influence of LASSO estimation on the scale of the covariates.  

### Preferences in Variable Selection Techniques
The choice of variable selection technique often depends on the dataset's characteristics and research objectives. Some researchers favor straightforward methods like backward elimination or forward selection for their simplicity and ease of interpretation, while others opt for more intricate approaches like LASSO when confronted with high-dimensional data. For instance, when the EPV falls between 10 and 25, LASSO selection may be a superior choice compared to other selection methods.  

The selection should align with research goals and account for data characteristics, including variable relationships and multicollinearity. Ultimately, the variable selection technique chosen should be guided by the specific requirements and objectives of the regression modeling task.
